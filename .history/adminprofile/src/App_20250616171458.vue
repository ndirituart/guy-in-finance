`, is actually designed to work exactly as a Vue Router application's root component should: it uses `<router-view />` as a placeholder for dynamic content based on your URL. This means it no longer directly renders components like `HelloWorld`.

The reason `AdminDashboard` is not explicitly imported and used within the `App.vue` template is that in a Vue Router setup, the router itself handles which component (like your `AdminDashboardHome.vue`) is displayed in the `<router-view />` based on the URL path. If you import and register it in `App.vue` but don't use it directly in the template, ESLint will correctly flag it as "registered but not used."

To make your `AdminDashboard` (which is `AdminDashboardHome.vue` in your `userinterface/admin/` folder) the default "builder page" when you first open your application, the change needs to happen in your **`router/index.js`** file. This is where you tell Vue Router what component to load for the root path (`/`).

Here's how your `router/index.js` should be configured to make `/admin` the default route when you hit your application's root URL (`/`):

```javascript
// src/router/index.js

// ... (your existing imports for all components)
// Ensure AdminDashboardHome is correctly imported:
import AdminDashboardHome from '../userinterface/admin/AdminDashboardHome.vue';


const routes = [
  // This line makes the root path '/' redirect to '/admin'
  { path: '/', redirect: '/admin' },

  // Your actual Admin Dashboard route
  { path: '/admin', name: 'AdminHome', component: AdminDashboardHome },

  // ... (all your other user and admin routes follow here)
  // For example:
  // { path: '/home', name: 'HomePage', component: HomePage },
  // { path: '/user-savings', name: 'UserSavings', component: UserSavings },
  // ...
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes,
});

// ... (your existing router.beforeEach guard for admin access)

export default router;
```

**What to do:**

1.  **Ensure your `App.vue` matches the Canvas:** Double-check that your local `App.vue` file exactly matches the one in the "Corrected App.vue" Canvas. It should **not** have a `<HelloWorld />` component or any other specific component directly rendered in its template, only the `<router-view />`.
2.  **Update `router/index.js`:** Make sure the `routes` array in your `router/index.js` file includes the `{ path: '/', redirect: '/admin' }` entry as shown above. This will tell Vue Router to automatically take users to your admin dashboard when they access the application's base URL.

This approach uses Vue Router as intended, keeping your `App.vue` clean as a layout component and properly directing traffic to your desired default page.
